# v3.1.0

## Release highlights

- Introduction of ARM releases and and general improvements to Docker builds
- Improvements to OIDC provider allowing pass-through of ID Tokens
- Multiple redirect domains can now be whitelisted
- Streamed responses are now flushed periodically

## Important notes

- If you have been using [#bitly/621](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy/pull/621)
  and have cookies larger than the 4kb limit,
  the cookie splitting pattern has changed and now uses `_` in place of `-` when
  indexing cookies.
  This will force users to reauthenticate the first time they use `v3.1.0`.
- Streamed responses will now be flushed every 1 second by default.
  Previously streamed responses were flushed only when the buffer was full.
  To retain the old behaviour set `--flush-interval=0`.
  See [#23](https://github.com/timothy-spencer/oauth2_proxy-1/pull/23) for further details.
